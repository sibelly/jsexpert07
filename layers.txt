index.js -> call all the layers

services ->
 - bussiness logic
 - external layer (api, databases, files)

 views -> dom interaction (html)

 controllers -> middleware between services and/or workers and views

 factories -> imports the dependencies
  - create the final objects to make the calls
  - return the function that initialize the flow for that component (init)

 workers -> background process
  - heavy logic (cpu usage)
  - all tht blocks the screen (for loop, ai, webcam, etc)
  - call the bussiness logic from the service
